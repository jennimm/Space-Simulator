# Space-Simulator

A simulation showing the planets orbiting the Sun.

We need:
-planets ( let user choose how many )
  -which orbit they are on (distance from sun)
  -the colour (choose hex codes/drop down menu of set colours)
  -the size in comparison to others (or just their radius)
  
-the orbital distances (i dont know what the technical term would be?)
-the scale we will use for size
